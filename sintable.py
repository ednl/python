from math import sin, cos, tau

# Quadrants and circle below are not in degrees but in "index units" as defined by the step
# If every integer degree is needed, then step = 1 and most of the code can be simplified
# If fractional degrees are also needed, then this code needs to be modified!
step = 3                # step in degrees, must divide 90
quad1 = 90 // step      # first quadrant 90 degrees [integer]
quad2 = 180 // step     # second quadrant 180 degrees [integer]
quad3 = 270 // step     # third quadrant 270 degrees [integer]
circle = 360 // step    # a full circle 360 degrees [integer]

d2r = tau / 360         # degrees to radians factor [float]
i2r = step * d2r        # index to radians factor [float]

# From index to degrees
def index2deg(a):
    return a * step

# From index to radians
def index2rad(a):
    return a * i2r

# Generate the lookup table with index 0..quad1 inclusive (= 0..90 degrees inclusive)
# In real code, this could (should) be a list of literal values
# Use the minimum amount of decimals necessary, choice here: 5
sintable = [round(sin(index2rad(i)), 5) for i in range(quad1 + 1)]

# Give sine of argument 'a' given in "index units" by using lookup table
# Argument 'a' is in stepped degrees where in this example the step is 3, so:
#   a = -1 => -3 degrees
#   a =  0 =>  0 degrees
#   a =  1 =>  3 degrees
#   a = 30 => 90 degrees
#   a = 31 => 93 degrees
# Argument a can be any integer but needs to be normalised, so this is slow for very big
# (positive or negative) values. It depends on the CPU and language implementation
# whether "mod" is faster than repeated adding/subtracting. On modern architectures,
# mod is definitely faster, but on the Apple IIe? I have no idea :)

    # Value of 'a' is now in the range 0..360 degrees inclusive
    # Map each quadrant onto the first quadrant which is in the lookup table
    # Each time, "greater than" is good because the lookup table includes 90 degrees

    if a > quad1:
